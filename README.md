# Phrase Hunter Game
 Treehouse FSJS Unit 4 Project 

 I made a few changes to the appearance of the game:

 1. I used Coolers.co to quickly find a different color palette. 
 2. I added a slight drop shadow to the title and the header. 
 3. slowed down the transition of the buttons and the phrase letter boxes so that they slowly fade into their new colors
 4. I also added a slight blur to the title.
 5. The last thing I did was add a pulse animation to the title screen.
